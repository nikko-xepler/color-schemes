# color-schemes

A node application for creating, editing, and exporting color schemes.


## Local Installation

When running locally, it is recommended to use `node-foreman` to load an `.env`
file into `process.env` in order to simulate a production environment.

To install `node-foreman`, run the following from the command line:

```
npm install -g foreman
```

Depending on your operating system, you may need to run the command as sudo to
allow for npm to install globally:

```
sudo npm install -g foreman
```

-----------

Once `node-foreman` is installed, you can start the local server with:

```
nf run node index.js
```
